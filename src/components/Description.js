        <p>
          Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and full of regret because you didn't invest
          in Amazon when it was a small book company? Well, if this happens to be the case, you can feel that regret
          with other investments too! ðŸ˜Ž With this little app, you will be able to select an investment and see how
          well it performed with a given date range. Here's some info to get you started:
        </p>
        <ul className="button-info-list">
          <li>
            Clicking the <span className="button-info">Stocks</span> button will list the available stocks to choose
            from.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <span className="button-info">Amount</span> field is the number of stocks that you wish to purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clicking the <span className="button-info">Start Date</span> calendar will list the dates the stock
            has existed for. The date entered represents when you purchased a particular investment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Similarly, the <span className="button-info">End Date</span> calendar will list the dates after the&nbsp;
            <span className="button-info">Start Date</span> that the stock has existed for. This represents the date in
            which you sold an investment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The line graph below shows how the stock performed over time. When the&nbsp;
          <span className="button-info">Start Date</span> and the <span className="button-info">End Date</span> are
          selected, vertical lines are drawn to highlight these years. Below that, you can see how well that investment
          performed and what it's worth now.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
